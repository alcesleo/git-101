# Git 101

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this talk you should first go through these steps:

1. Download and install Git from this website: <https://git-scm.com/> (if you are on Windows, you should choose to use Git Bash during the installation)
2. Open a terminal
    - Mac/Linux: Open the **Terminal** application
    - Windows: Open the **Git Bash** application
3. Run `git --version` in the terminal. It should output something like "git version 2.6.2" if Git is installed correctly.
4. Accustom yourself with using the terminal basics
    - run `pwd` to show the current path (present working directory)
    - run `ls` to list the files and folders inside this directory
    - run `cd path/to/destination` to go into a directory of your choosing (change directory)
    - run `cd ..` to go up one directory
    - run `mkdir my-git-playground` to make a new directory

NOTE: Using Windows you can also create a directory as usual, then right click and select Git Bash to open a terminal in this folder.

It is a good idea to create a GitHub account as well, I will show you how to use it in the talk and you can also comment on this document if you have any questions about the other steps. Just click the sign up button below.
